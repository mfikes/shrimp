Shrimp
======

Example project using [Goby](https://github.com/mfikes/goby).

Overview
========

This is a sample project illustrating the use of Goby, which is some glue code facilitating the creation of iOS apps in ClojureScript.

This repo is really two projects in one:

1. An iOS app which contains the Storyboards and which loads the compiled JavaScript.
2. A ClojureScript project which contains implementations for the view controllers.

This project illustrates how UIKit elements are injected into ClojureScript and how Objective-C protocols such as `UITableViewDataSource` are implemented. It also shows how CoreData can be used, injecting (mutable) CoreData objects into ClojureScript.

[This blog post](http://blog.fikesfarm.com/posts/2015-03-05-ambly-app-bootstrapping.html) delves into more of the detail on how the Ambly REPL is integrated into Shrimp.

Running
=======

To set up the Shrimp Xcode project, go into `shrimp/iOS` and do `pod install`.

To run Shrimp, first go into the `ClojureScript` directory and run 
```
clojure -m cljs.main -t none -c shrimp.core
``` 
This will produce the `main.js` file and `out` directory referenced in the iOS project workspace. 

Then open `iOS/Shrimp.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the project in an iPhone simulator. You should see the main UI come up with a list view showing a list of shrimp names. Tap on any of these to see editable details.

REPL
====

To interact with the app via the Ambly REPL:

1. Run `./repl.sh` in the `ClojureScript` directory
2. Choose `[1] Shrimp on iPhone Simulator (<computer name>)`.
3. In the REPL, do `(in-ns 'shrimp.detail-view-controller)`.
4. In the app, tap on one of the shrimp names to go to a detail view.
5. Try updating the text in one of the fields with `(set! (.-text @name-text-field) "Hello")`.

You can also establish a REPL with a test device; simply follow the same steps but run the app on a device and choose the device when starting the REPL.
